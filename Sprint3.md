## üöÄ Project Overview (Sprint 3)

Our project successfully delivered a comprehensive Admin Analytics Dashboard that includes four key charts to visualize crucial metrics. We implemented a grouped bar chart for campaign performance, a line chart for campaign creation trends, a donut chart for campaign success distribution, and a scatter chart for daily revenue by category. The development also featured intuitive navigation components with a left-side panel managing restricted and unrestricted routes, and a right-side panel integrating API-driven notifications. Additionally, we built a dynamic Campaigns Dashboard where admin users can edit campaign statuses while regular users retain view-only access. Enhanced interactivity was achieved through long-press functionality on chart components. Comprehensive unit tests using Vitest and React Testing Library, along with end-to-end tests via Cypress, ensured frontend robustness. On the backend, full CRUD endpoints were established for Notifications, Support Tickets, Payment Transactions, and Withdrawals, with specific admin-only operations. Rigorous unit testing of these endpoints further solidified our platform‚Äôs reliability and security. Overall, our coordinated efforts resulted in a secure, interactive, and thoroughly tested platform that meets diverse user needs.
