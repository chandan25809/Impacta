## üöÄ Project Overview (Sprint 3)

In Sprint 3, we significantly enhanced our crowdfunding platform by integrating advanced analytics on the frontend and expanding robust API functionalities on the backend. On the frontend, we developed a comprehensive Admin Analytics Dashboard that features four key visualizations: a grouped bar chart displaying campaign performance by category (segregating approved, pending, and completed campaigns), a line chart that illustrates campaign creation trends over time, a donut chart that visualizes campaign success distribution, and a point chart that presents daily revenue by category. Additionally, we refined the navigation system by introducing both right-side and left-side navigation panels to manage restricted and unrestricted routes, while also enhancing the campaigns dashboard to allow admin-exclusive editing capabilities. On the backend, we extended functionality by implementing full CRUD endpoints for notifications, support tickets, payment transactions, and withdrawals‚Äîwith role-based restrictions for critical updates and bulk deletions‚Äîand created comprehensive unit tests to ensure stability. These improvements collectively provide a dynamic, data-driven experience that enables efficient campaign management, robust communication, and secure financial tracking across the platform.
